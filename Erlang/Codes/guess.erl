	% Complete your code here.
	% This is the code for the server.

clientReceive() ->
	% Complete your code here.
	% This is the code for the client to handle the messages sent by the server (the feedback on the guess).

clientSend(Node) ->
	% Complete your code here.
	% This is the code for the client to send messages to the server.
	% You can use {server, Node} ! {N} to send a guess to the server.
	% Do not forget to include node() when sendind a message to the server, otherwise the server will not know in which node your process is running.

% Starts the session in the server
start(N) ->

% Starts the session in the client.
% The names of the process are already defined for your convenience.
